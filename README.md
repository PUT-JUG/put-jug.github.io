[![Deploy JUG site to Pages](https://github.com/PUT-JUG/put-jug.github.io/actions/workflows/action.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PUT-JUG/put-jug.github.io/actions/workflows/action.yml)

**It is a website aggregating repositories with courses IRIM provides.**

**The link to the webpage is: [https://put-jug.github.io/](https://put-jug.github.io/)**

## How-to

- I created a new course. How to add it to the PUT-JUG?

Modify the `repositories_list.txt` file by adding a link to your repository in the github.com/PUT-JUG domain. After committing, the building of a new page should start automatically. You can monitor the `Actions` tabs. 

- I modified my course, but the changes need to be visible on the PUT-JUG webpage.

If you want to deploy changes to the PUT-JUG website, you need to trigger actions to page building:
1. Go to the `Actions` tab (on this repository, not your course).
2. On the left side, select the "Deploy JUG site to Pages" button.
3. On the right side, select the "Run workflow" button, and next confirm by clicking the green button.

4. Wait until actions are not fished.
